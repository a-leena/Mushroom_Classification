# Mushroom Classification
The objective of this project is to classify mushrooms as ‘edible’ or ‘poisonous’, using several different machine learning models, based on various physical features of mushrooms such as their cap shape and color, gill size and color, odor, bruises, population, etc. 
The dataset used, that was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?resource=download), contains 8124 instances of mushrooms with 22 physical characteristics and a binary target/class label – ‘p’ for poisonous and ‘e’ for edible.
